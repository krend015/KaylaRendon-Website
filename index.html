        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">SociologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">As a current sociology major, I am currently striving
        to obtain my degree in Sociology and eventually also receive a Master's Degree
        in Sociology. Ever since I was young, I have always wanted to help others.
        It has been my goal all my life which is why I am trying to obtain my degree.
        With my degree, I want to become a Social Worker as I believe there are not
        enough in the world. Thousands of individuals are in need in one, but due to
        the lack of Social Workers, many people are stuck in trouble with no help.
        <br><br>

        I specifically want to focus on helping children. It breaks my heart seeing 
        children in horrible situations with no one to help. They are often left hopeless
        with no real joy. I want to help as many kids as I can and show them the positive 
        of the world. It can be very frightening living that way, so I want to help 
        as many kids as I can in order to give them hope and help them out of their
        situation.<br><br>

        Currently, I am a second year at University of California Riverside and I am 
        taking my final lower division courses. Within the next two years, I will be
        completing my upper division courses and graduating.<br><br>
        
        The work experience I have is as a cashier at WingStop. At this job, I would assist
        customers walking in by taking their order and handling the transaction. If there
        was no customers present I would clean around the store. Overall, I learned
        a great deal of skills from this job that I still use to this day.
        This developed my customer service skills as well as time management.<br><br>
        
        My second job was as a Sales Associate at Hollister. At this job, I worked all
        around the store. Some of my tasks included folding down the store, as well as
        being a cashier and assisting customers. I have utilized both of these jobs to really learn
        how to be in a work environment and assist individuals.<br><br>
        
        I hop to obtain a teaching assistant job this summer as I will be able to gain
        experience for my future job as a Social Worker. I will be working with
        children and learning the mannerisms of children. This will help me as 
        I will learn more about how children are and how they interact. I will 
        use these skills in the future as I will understand how to be able to really
        speak to children in a way that they can better understand. <br><br>
        
        Overall, I hope that I can use all these skills in order to be the best Social
        Worker I can. I want to help as many people as possible and be a role model for
        my siblings and family. I want to be the best person I can and inspire the people
        I work for. I want to give them hope and make them feel better. I want to give
        them a new perspective for their lives and inspire them to do better and have a better
        life.
